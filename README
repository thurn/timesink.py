This is a simple script I hacked together to browse the imgur gallery for a
fixed number of seconds (specified by a command-line argument). The idea is
sort of that this will help me kill time while waiting for awkward lengths
of time (like 60 seconds).

It tracks what images you've seen in a file and avoids showing them more
than once. Any key or click to advance the images. Requires python3 and
cherrypy.
